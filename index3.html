        <p id="page-1-content">
          A woman was waiting at an airport one night, with several long hours
          before her flight. She hunted for a book in the airport shops, bought
          a bag of cookies and found a place to drop. <br /><br />

          She was engrossed in her book but happened to see, that the man
          sitting beside her, as bold as could be. . .grabbed a cookie or two
          from the bag in between, which she tried to ignore to avoid a
          scene.<br /><br />

          So she munched the cookies and watched the clock, as the gutsy cookie
          thief diminished her stock. She was getting more irritated as the
          minutes ticked by, thinking, “If I wasn’t so nice, I would blacken his
          eye.”<br /><br />

          With each cookie she took, he took one too, when only one was left,
          she wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, and a nervous
          laugh, he took the last cookie and broke it in half. <br /><br />

          He offered her half, as he ate the other, she snatched it from him and
          thought… oooh, brother. This guy has some nerve and he’s also rude,
          why he didn’t even show any gratitude! <br /><br />

          She had never known when she had been so galled, and sighed with
          relief when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and
          headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate.<br /><br />

          She boarded the plane, and sank in her seat, then she sought her book,
          which was almost complete. As she reached in her baggage, she gasped
          with surprise, there was her bag of cookies, in front of her eyes.<br /><br />

          If mine are here, she moaned in despair, the others were his, and he
          tried to share. Too late to apologize, she realized with grief, that
          she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief.<br /><br />
